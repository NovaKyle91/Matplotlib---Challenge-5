# Matplotlib---Challenge-5
Matplotlib - Challenge 5

Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to review my Challenge 5 from Module 5.

I enjoyed working on this assignment as I had a great time with Matplotlibs.

My work and analysis can be found on the ipynb file labeled Pymaceuticals_KNovak_Challenge 5.

I have also included the csv files that came with the starter code.

I ran through the code multiple times and debugged any errors I faced.

As always, please reach out should you have any questions.

Cheers,
- Kyle Novak
